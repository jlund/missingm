Being a fan of [webOS][1] has been hard work. You had to be really, really good at seeing the light at the end of the tunnel. And you had to be able to convince yourself that the light was actually drawing closer and amounted to something more than the fading embers of a dying star. After [today's news][2] I don't think that very many people will be able to do that anymore.

Palm, you were responsible for my first smartphone, you made my first PDA, and you were an early leader in a movement that has now left you behind. I miss you already.
